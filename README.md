## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first project using CSS Flexbox. It were a wonderful experience. Positioning and building up the layout was increasingly easier than using common CSS properties like float, inline and block.

### Continued development

Now my next step is to learn and apply CSS Grid. This will be a funny journey. As the time pass by and I learn and apply this new knowledge I like more and more Front End Development.
